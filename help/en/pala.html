    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>In Pala: Impressionism, you do not want to score points. The game ends
        when a player reaches 45 points or more; the player with the lowest
        score wins.</p>

    <h2>Deck Composition</h2>
    <p>48 cards (8 each of red, blue, and yellow - 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5; 8 each of
        orange, green, and purple - 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)</p>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Each player is dealt 11 cards.</li>
        <li>The remaining 4 cards are discarded face-down and are not used for
            the current hand.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Bidding</h2>
    <p>In turn order, each player may play one card onto an available slot or
        pass; you cannot bid a color already played. Continue until all four
        slots are filled. The colors on the board determine scoring at round's
        end; card values are irrelevant.</p>

    <h2>Trick Play</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Lead:</strong> Winner of the previous trick plays any one
            card to set the trick's initial color.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Follow Suit:</strong> In clockwise order, if you have a card
            in the trick's color:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary (red/blue/yellow):</strong> play one card of
                    that color.</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary (orange/green/purple):</strong> either
                    play one card of that color or <em>mix</em>.</li>
            </ul>
            If you have no cards in the trick's color, you may:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mix</strong> (secondary only): play two primary
                    cards that combine to the secondary color; their values sum.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Smear</strong> (primary only): play one different
                    primary card onto the current winning card to change the
                    color, then play one secondary card of that new color.</li>
                <li><strong>Junk</strong>: play any single non-matching card.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Awarding Tricks</h2>
    <p>After all have played, the highest-value card (or summed value if mixed)
        in the trick's final color wins; the winner takes all cards into their
        score pile and leads the next trick.</p>

    <h2>Ending the Round</h2>
    <p>Players who run out of cards sit out. The round ends after a trick if the
        winner has no cards or only one player remains with cards.</p>

    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Take all won-trick cards into your score pile, then add any
            remaining hand cards.</li>
        <li>For each card in your pile:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Color not on board:</strong> discard it (0 points).
                </li>
                <li><strong>X space (cancel) color:</strong> discard one other
                    card for each (highest value cards will automatically be
                    discarded); excess cancel cards are -1 point each.</li>
                <li><strong>+1 space colors:</strong> 1 point per card.
                </li>
                <li><strong>+# space color:</strong> score the card's face value
                    in points.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>End of Game</h2>
    <p>If no one has reached 45 points, the cards are all shuffled and another
        hand is played. The game ends when a player reaches 45 or more points;
        the player with the lowest score wins.</p>
