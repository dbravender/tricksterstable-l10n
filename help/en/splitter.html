    <h2>Splitter</h2>

    <p>Splitter is a roll-and-write game designed by Stefan Nikolic. The game
        can be played with any number of players
        but the Trickster's Table implementation only allows solo play.</p>

    <h3>Game Overview</h3>
    <p>
        You roll two dice each turn. The dice to be played will be displayed on
        the bottom of the screen. For example,
        this is
        what a 4 and 5 roll would look like:</p>

    <img src="splitter/4and5.png">

    <p>One die's value must be placed on any unoccupied spot on the board. The
        value from the other die must be placed
        on the opposite side of the board as though there was a mirror running
        down the middle of the board. Tap on an
        empty spot on the board to place the dice and lock your move in by
        tapping the + symbol in the bottom right.</p>

    <p>For example, if you roll a 4 and a 5 you may place them like this:</p>

    <img src="splitter/4and5place1.png" />

    <p>Or like this (or any other white square on the board for that matter)</p>

    <img src="splitter/4and5place2.png" />

    <p>The goal is to score as many points as possible.
        Points are scored when there are exactly as many of the value displayed
        on the dice in a cluster of orthoganally adjacent dice.
        When a cluster is worth points the background color will fill in.</p>

    <p>For example, each 1 by itself will score one point (the total score for
        this board is 2 points):</p>

    <img src="splitter/1and1scoring.png" />

    <p>
        However, if two 1s are next to each other they are worth 0 points:</p>

    <img src="splitter/1and1notscoring.png" />

    <p>Two 2s score 2 points, and three 3s score 3 points, and four 4s score 4
        points, etc.</p>

    <p>Any valid clusters that have a * square are worth double points.</p>

    <p>On the B board type there are also squares marked with "s. If you put the
        same number in all boxes with a " you
        will receive 5 points. If you put a different number in one of the "s
        you will get 0 points for this bonus. The
        " will disappear to let you know this.</p>
