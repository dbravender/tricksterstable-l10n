    <h3>Theme</h3>

    <p>Welcome to 1935 Bollywoods! It's Oscar night and the stars have come to
        walk the red carpet, or rather crawl. See this is Bollywoods, Bear
        Hollywood, and these osos are oh so stylish. Thankfully, Goldilocks has
        agreed to put the past in the past and make you just the right fit for
        your zoot suit-not too long and not too short. Now try your darndest to
        be the Bear of the Ball and win beast dressed!</p>

    <h3>The Hook</h3>

    <p>A trick-taking game where players will take advantage of their own
        personal draw deck to be short-suited at the same rate as they win
        tricks.</p>

    <p>Setup</p>

    <p>In Trickster's Table Short Zoot Suit is played with 3 players.
        Cards are valued 1-12 in 4 suits.</p>

    <h3>Gameplay Flow</h3>

    <p>At the start of a round, players pick any 5 cards from the cards they
        were dealt. Players then flip these 5 cards facedown, shuffle them, and
        place them into a pile in front of themselves. This is the draw pile for
        the player. Before every trick begins, anyone may draw 1 card from their
        personal draw deck. If, after this, anyone has 0 cards left in their
        hand (not draw deck), the round is over. The trick-taking is must
        follow, with no trump. The highest card of the lead suit wins.
        The winner takes the trick, except for any non-lead-suit cards. Those
        cards go back to the player who played them, face-up into that player's
        shorts pile.</p>

    <h3>Scoring</h3>

    <p>Players earn 1 point per trick won and 3 points for each pair of won
        trick and card in their shorts pile. If the number of tricks they won
        equals the number of shorts, the player earns 5 points per pair rather
        than just 3 points.</p>

    <h3>End of Round</h3>

    <p>Players play rounds per player, where the next round’ s start player is
        the person to the left of the previous round’ s start player.</p>

    <h3>End of Game</h3>

    <p>Most points wins! Congrats on being best dressed!</p>

    <p>If tied, the tied players select a movie from a randomly generated list
        of Taylor's favorite movies plus some movies that aren't his favorite.
        The player who selected Taylor's highest ranked movie wins!</p>
