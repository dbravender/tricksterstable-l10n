    <h3>Game Overview</h3>
    <p>You want to capture <b>4 or more Boss Yokai (7s)</b> to win a round. You
        will <b>lose the round if you win 13 tricks</b>. If you play all 23
        tricks, then the player who won the last trick wins the round.</p>

    <h4>Card Distributions</h4>

    <img src="yokai-distribution.png" />

    <h3>Round Setup</h3>

    <p>The deck of 49 cards is shuffled. 7 cards are dealt face-down to each
        player. 6 cards are placed face-up on top of the previous 7 cards. These
        piles are called the straw piles.</p>

    <p>Next, <b>11 cards are dealt face-down</b> to each player. One card is
        dealt face-up which determines the <b>Trump Suit</b> for the round.</p>

    <p>Finally, each <b>player discards one card</b> from their hand face-down.
        <b>You may not discard a Boss Yokai.</b> The discarded cards are not
        used this round.
    </p>

    <h3>Before the Round Begins</h3>

    <p>If you have Boss Yokai cards face-up in your straw pile, you may choose
        to swap one of them with one of the two cards beneath it. <b>You may not
            look at the face-down cards before deciding to swap</b>. If the
        face-down card you chose is also a Boss Yokai, then you must choose
        which one to keep face-up and which one to turn face-down. (Please note
        that in the Trickster's Table implementation, Boss Yokai cards will not
        appear as face-up cards on the straw pile.)</p>

    <p>The player who dealt the cards leads the first trick. In subsequent
        rounds, swap the dealer so that the first lead changes each round.</p>

    <h3>Game Play Rules</h3>
    <p>Each round, you'll play multiple turns called Tricks where each player
        will play one card from their hand.
        The Lead Player will play first. They choose any card from their hand
        and play it face-up in front of them. The other player must now play a
        card of the same suit as the Lead Player. If a player has no cards of
        that suit, they may play any card in their hand.</p>

    <h4>Taking a trick</h4>
    <p>After both players have played a card, check to see if either played the
        <b>A card</b>. If they did, that player takes the trick.
    </p>

    <p>If neither played the A card, check if either played <b>a card of the
            Trump Suit</b>. If either did, then the higher card of that suit
        takes the trick.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, if both players played the same suit then the higher card
        takes the trick. If two different suits were played then the Lead Player
        takes the trick.</p>

    <p>The player who took the trick now becomes the Lead Player.</p>

    <h3>End of a Round</h3>
    <p>The round is over, and a round winner is determined, if any of the
        following has happened.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A player who has captured a total of <b>4 or more Boss Yokai cards
                wins</b> the round.</li>
        <li>A player has taken <b>13 tricks but has captured 3 or fewer Boss
                Yokai cards. The other player wins</b> the round.</li>
        <li>No one has cards left in their hands. <b>The player who won the last
                trick</b> wins the round.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Scoring</h3>

    <p>Only the player who won a round scores points. The other player <b>does
            not score</b>, regardless of how many cards they took.</p>

    <p>If a player has won the round because the other player took 13 tricks,
        the winning player <b>takes all Boss Yokai cards remaining in both
            players' hands and the straw piles</b>. They add these to the Boss
        Yokai they took this round.</p>

    <p>The winning player scores as many points as there are white stars on Boss
        Yokai they captured this round (ignoring the Boss Yokai of the trump
        suit).</p>

    <h3>End of the Game</h3>
    <p>If a player has 7 or more points they win!</p>

    <p>Otherwise, a new hand is dealt and another round is played. The lead
        alternates between players.</p>
