<h3>Deck Composition</h3>

<ul>
    <li>52 cards in 4 colors
        <ul>
            <li>14 red cards valued 5-18 (16-18 are Evil Potato cards and are marked with a black border)</li>
            <li>13 blue cards valued 4-16</li>
            <li>12 green cards valued 3-14</li>
            <li>13 yellow cards valued 1-13 (1-3 are Potato Man cards and are marked with a black border)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>15 point cards in 5 colors
        <ul>
            <li>3 point cards per card color</li>
            <li>3 neutral point cards worth 5 points each</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>The deck is shuffled and dealt. Each player receives 12 cards. The remaining cards are removed from the hand.</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>The human player begins by playing any card they wants from their hand. The other players follow in clockwise order until each of them has played one card. The following rule applies for playing the cards:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Each color may only be played once in a trick! In other words, each player must play a different color in a trick.</li>
    <li>If a player is unable to play a card, the hand ends immediately.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Taking a Trick</h3>

<p>The player who has played the highest number in the trick wins it. If two players lay out the same highest number in a trick, the card that was played later wins.</p>

<p>A trick that contains Evil Potato as well as Potato Man is always won by Potato Man. This applies regardless of what other cards are part of the trick.</p>

<p>The player who takes the trick receives one point card in the color they won the trick with.</p>

<p>If there are no point cards left of the winning color, the winner of the trick earns  one of the 5-point cards (if available).</p>

<p>The winner of a trick plays the first card of the next trick.</p>

<h3>End of a Round</h3>

<p>If a player can no longer play a suitable card, their cards are revealed and the round ends immediately. No point card is earned for this incomplete trick and a new hand is dealt.</p>

<p>Additionally, a round can end when all the players have played all their cards.</p>

<p>For the next hand, the deck is shuffled and new hands are dealt to each player. Point cards are reset.</p>

<h3>End of the Game</h3>

<p>After four hands the game ends.</p>

<p>In case of a tie, play continues until there is a clear winner. (Note that this tiebreaker is different from the original game.)</p>
