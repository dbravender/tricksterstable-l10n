<h3>Play (4 players)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Best of Neapolitan is played with a deck that consists of 3 suits each
        containing cards valued 1 through 9 and
        three suitless pass cards.</li>
    <li>Each player is dealt 7 cards and the remaining 2 cards are placed face
        up.</li>
    <li>Trump is displayed at the top left of the screen. The order of trump is
        randomly determined before each hand and
        is heirarchical. Any card from the topmost trump will beat any card from
        the middle trump and so on. After each
        trick, the suit of the winning card will move to the bottom of the
        heirarchy.</li>
    <li>Best of Neapolitan is a must-follow game. When leading, you may play any
        card. If a card has been led you must
        follow its suit if you can.
        The exception to this rule is pass cards which may be played at any time
        (even if you could have followed suit).
        Pass cards cannot win a trick.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scoring (4 players)</h3>

<p>Players score based on how many tricks they took in a round.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Players that took exactly 2 tricks score 1 point.</li>
    <li>Players that took exactly 0 tricks score 2 points.</li>
    <li>Any other trick count scores 0 points.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Objective</h3>

<p>The objective of Best of Neapolitan is to get to 5 points first. If there is
    a
    tie for first place additional rounds
    are played until there is a clear winner (the original game has different
    tie breaker rules than the app
    implementation).</p>
