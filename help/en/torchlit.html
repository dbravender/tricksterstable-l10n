    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>In this trick-taking game, players decide when to win tricks and when to
        increase the value of the number of tricks they think they will take.
        After 3 rounds, the player with the most points wins!</p>

    <h2>Deck Makeup</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>63 Monster Cards (0-7 in 7 colors)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note: the Trickster's Table implementation of this game uses standard
        4-player rules but the physcial version supports 2-5 players and has
        variant rules. See the official rulebook for more details.</p>

    <h2>Round Flow</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Light a Torch:</strong> Each player selects a card face down
            as their torch (a guess at how many tricks they'll win).</li>
        <li><strong>Play Tricks:</strong> Players play cards clockwise,
            following suit if able. Dragon cards allow free play. Determine the
            winning number (highest dragon or highest of lead color).</li>
        <li><strong>Move Adventurers:</strong> All who played the winning number
            advance one dungeon. From dungeon 7, move to 0.</li>
        <li><strong>Spawn Monsters:</strong> Player who played the lowest number
            becomes Dungeon Warden and places cards into matching-numbered
            dungeons (one per color).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Final Trick</h2>
    <p>Before the final trick, players take back their torch card. No
        suit-following requirement this round. Proceed with trick as usual.</p>

    <h2>Relight Torches</h2>
    <p>Reveal the unplayed card. If its number matches your dungeon location,
        place it face down as a relit torch (worth bonus). Otherwise, place it
        in that dungeon as a dropped torch card.</p>

    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 points per dropped torch card</li>
        <li>2 points per dragon card</li>
        <li>1 point per other monster card</li>
        <li>Divide dungeon score among all players in the same dungeon (rounded
            down)</li>
        <li>+3 points for relighting your torch</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prepare Next Round</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Return pawns to dungeon 0</li>
        <li>Shuffle and redeal cards</li>
        <li>New round starts with previous Dungeon Warden</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>End of Game</h2>
    <p>After 3 rounds, the player with the highest total score wins. In a tie,
        the player with the highest score in round 3 wins. Still tied? Share
        victory. (Note: in the Trickster's Table implementation, if the human
        player's score after 3 rounds is tied for the highest score it is
        counted as a win for the human player. Don't tell the bots.)</p>
