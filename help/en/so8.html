        rulebook.</p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The object of the game is to capture tricks and score the most points.
    </p>

    <h2>Components</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Crown timeline token</li>
        <li>63 cards that form the deck: 13 black, 13 red, 9 orange, 6 yellow, 9
            green, 12 blue, and a King</li>
        <li>3 timeline cards</li>
        <li>Church of England card</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>The timeline shows which suit is currently trump and when it will change.
        At the beginning of the game, Catherine of Aragon is Queen, and black is
        trump. The token moves along the timeline after each trick.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shuffle all 63 cards. Deal 15 cards to each player. Three cards will
            remain face down out of the game.</li>
        <li>Players exchange two cards face down with their partner before
            beginning the game.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>Players take turns playing cards clockwise, following the suit led
        whenever possible. If a player cannot follow suit, they may play any
        card.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The timeline crown indicates which suit is currently trump. It is
            allowed—but not required—to lead the trump suit.</li>
        <li>The highest trump card played to a trick wins the trick. If no trump
            is played, the highest card of the suit led wins the trick.</li>
        <li>The player who wins the trick collects the cards played and advances
            the timeline token one space along the track. If the token is on the
            last space, proceed to scoring.</li>
        <li>The winner of the trick leads to the next trick.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each team earns one point for each trick won.</li>
        <li>The number of diamonds on the cards collected in those tricks is
            added to the team's score.</li>
        <li>The team with the most points after all tricks are played wins the
            hand.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advanced Rules</h2>
    <h3>The King Card</h3>
    <p>The King card is the color of the current reign. It is the highest trump
        card in the game and will always win the trick in which it is played. It
        may be played any time a player can play the current trump color:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is the lead card for the trick, or</li>
        <li>Trump was led, or</li>
        <li>A player is out of the led suit.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The King card cannot be pulled from hand to follow suit (you are never
        forced to play it unless it's your only card left).</p>

    <h3>The Zero Cards</h3>
    <p>The zero cards are spies, working to undermine the rival side:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>The Black 0:</b> Part of the black suit. It must be followed with
            black cards if black is led. It can also be played as a red 13 to
            follow a red lead but cannot be pulled from the hand to follow red.
            The black 0 can win as trump when played as a red 13 during Anne
            Boleyn's reign.</li>
        <li><b>The Red 0:</b> Behaves similarly but is flipped to operate
            inversely.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Church of England</h3>
    <p>The Church of England card may be used once per hand to annul a trick
        after all cards have been played:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Neither team gets points for the cards or the trick.</li>
        <li>The timeline token is still advanced.</li>
        <li>The player who would have won the annulled trick leads the next
            trick.</li>
        <li>The Church of England card cannot be used on a trick that includes
            the King card.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The team with fewer points after scoring controls the Church of England
        card for the next hand. If there is a tie, neither team controls it.</p>

    <h2>The Queens</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Black: Catherine of Aragon</li>
        <li>Red: Anne Boleyn</li>
        <li>Orange: Jane Seymour</li>
        <li>Yellow: Anne of Cleves</li>
        <li>Green: Catherine Howard</li>
        <li>Blue: Catherine Parr</li>
    </ul>
