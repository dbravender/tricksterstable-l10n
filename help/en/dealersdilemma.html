    <h2>GAME OBJECTIVE</h2>
    <p>Win exactly the number of tricks you bid.</p>
    <h2>PLAYERS</h2>
    <p>3 players</p>
    <h2>CARDS</h2>
    <p>2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 in 4 suits</p>

    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>In Dealer's Dilemma, use your intuition to predict how many tricks you
        will win each round. Some cards in your hand are used to place bids,
        while the rest are played to tricks. This game is inspired by Wimm√ºln
        and Ninety-nine.</p>

    <h2>SETUP</h2>
    <p>Select a Dealer at random. Dealer shuffles all the cards and deals 12 to
        the other players and 10 to themselves. The Dealer takes the remaining 2
        cards and places them face up for everyone to see.</p>
    <p>Then, the Dealer picks one of the cards into their hand. The suit of that
        card will be the trump suit for this round. If both cards have the same
        suit, then the Dealer can pick that suit as trump, or can decide there
        is no trump suit for this round.</p>
    <p>The non-chosen card of the 2 must be led by the Dealer to start the first
        trick.</p>

    <h2>BID PHASE</h2>
    <p>Starting from the Dealer, each player bids by putting 2 cards from their
        hand onto the table in front of them. These cards are not used for trick
        play. The rank (number) value on a card is how many tricks you predict
        that you will take.</p>
    <p>Easy bid: If you make 2 predictions, put one card face-down and another
        card face-up next to it. The face-down card is a hidden bid. You can
        meet either of these bids.</p>
    <p>Risky bid: If you make only 1 prediction, you will choose one of the
        following 3 options.
    <ol>
        <li>Top card bid: Put a card face-up for everyone to see and another
            card face-up on top of it. The top card is your single bid value.
        </li>
        <li>Difference bid: Put a card face-up for everyone to see and another
            card face-up on top of it sideways. The difference between the 2
            card ranks is your single bid value.</li>
        <li>Zero bid: If you predict taking no tricks, put 2 cards face-up, next
            to each other.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>PLAY PHASE</h2>
    <p>For trick taking, starting with the Dealer each player plays a single
        card to the trick clockwise. Players must follow suit if possible. If
        you cannot follow suit, play any card. The highest trump number card
        wins. If no trump is played, the highest number in the led suit wins.
        The winner of a trick leads to the next one. Continue until all cards
        are played.</p>

    <h2>SCORE</h2>
    <p>After playing all tricks in a round, calculate scores, adding to previous
        scores.
    <ul>
        <li>Easy bid: If the number of tricks won is equal to the hidden card:
            score <b>2 points</b>.</li>
        <li>Easy bid: If the number of tricks won is equal to the revealed card:
            score <b>4 points</b>.</li>
        <li>Zero bid: If you bid zero and successfully take no tricks: score
            <b>6 points</b>.
        </li>
        <li>Top card or Difference bid: If the number of tricks won is equal to
            your bid: score <b>8 points</b>.</li>
        <li>Failing your easy bid: <b>-1 point</b> per trick missed from your
            lowest bid value.</li>
        <li>Failing your risky bid: <b>-2 points</b> per trick missed from your
            bid value.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>CONTINUING THE GAME</h2>
    <p>Repeat the setup steps for a new round. The Dealer rotates clockwise to
        the left of the previous Dealer. After playing 6 rounds, the player with
        the highest score wins. If there's a tie, all tied players win.</p>

    <h2>Bid examples</h2>
    <h3>Easy bid:</h3>
    <p>2 ?</p>

    <p>You are bidding either 2 tricks or the hidden number of tricks. If the
        hidden card is 4 and you end up taking 5 tricks, you will score -3
        points because your lowest bid was 2.</p>

    <h3>Risky bid:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Top card bid:
            <p>2 4</p>
            <p>You are bidding 2 tricks exactly. If you collect 4 tricks, your
                score will be -4 points because you missed your bid by 2 tricks.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Difference bid:
            <p>4 2</p>
            <p>You are bidding 2 tricks exactly (4-2). If you collect 2 tricks,
                you will score 8 points for meeting your bid.</p>

        <li>Zero bid:
            <p>2 4</p>
            <p>You are bidding 0 tricks exactly. If you collect 4 tricks, your
                score will be -8 points because you missed your bid by 4 tricks.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
