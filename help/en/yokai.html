        basis for the passing algorithm used by the AI). Additionally, thank you
        to Dan Kobayashi, Justin Radziewicz,
        and HollandOates (Jason) for reviewing the algorithm and recommending
        changes. Should the cards passed by the AI meet your needs please praise
        them. Should the cards you receive frustrate you, feel free to blame me.

    <p><b>Important note</b>: your partner will try to short suit themselves in
        red (if they can) and they expect you to short suit yourself in blue (if
        you can).</p>

    <h3>Game Overview</h3>
    <p>You and your partner (who sits across from you) want to capture <b>4 or
            more Boss Yokai (7s)</b> to win a round.
        You will <b>lose the round if you win 7 tricks</b> before capturing 4
        Boss Yokai.
        If all tricks are played, then the team who won the last trick wins the
        round.</p>

    <h4>Card Distributions</h4>

    <img src=" yokai-distribution.png" />

    <h3>Round Setup</h3>

    <p>The deck of 49 cards is shuffled. 12 cards are dealt face-down to each
        player.</p>

    <p>Next, one card is dealt face-up which determines the <b>Trump Suit</b>
        for the round.</p>

    <h3>Before the Round Begins</h3>

    <p>Each player selects three cards to pass to their partner. You may pass
        any cards. In the Trickster's Table implementation your partner is
        expecting you to short suit yourself in blue and they are attempting to
        short suit themselves in red.</p>

    <p>In the first round of a game the player with the green A leads. The lead
        moves clockwise to the next player after each hand.</p>

    <h3>Game Play Rules</h3>
    <p>Each round, you'll play multiple turns called Tricks where each player
        will play one card from their hand.
        The Lead Player will play first. They choose any card from their hand
        and play it face-up in front of them. In clockwise order, the other
        players must now play a
        card of the same suit as the Lead Player. If a player has no cards of
        that suit, they may play any card in their hand.</p>

    <h4>Taking a trick</h4>
    <p>After all players have played a card, check to see if anyone played the
        <b>A card</b>. If they did, that player takes the trick.
    </p>

    <p>If no one played the A card, check if anyone played <b>a card of the
            Trump Suit</b>. If anyone did, then the highest card of that suit
        takes the trick.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, if all players played the same suit then the highest card
        takes the trick. If two different suits were played then the highest
        card of the suit of the card played by the Lead Player
        takes the trick.</p>

    <p>The player who took the trick now becomes the Lead Player.</p>

    <h3>End of a Round</h3>
    <p>The round is over, and a round winner is determined, if any of the
        following has happened.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A team that has captured a total of <b>4 or more Boss Yokai cards
                wins</b> the round.</li>
        <li>A team has taken <b>7 tricks but has captured 3 or fewer Boss
                Yokai cards. The other team wins</b> the round.</li>
        <li>No one has cards left in their hands. <b>The team who won the last
                trick</b> wins the round.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Scoring</h3>

    <p>Only the team who won a round scores points. The other team <b>does
            not score</b>, regardless of how many cards they took.</p>

    <p>If a team has won the round because the other team took 7 tricks,
        the winning team <b>takes all Boss Yokai cards remaining in all
            players' hands</b>. They add these to the Boss Yokai they took this
        round.</p>

    <p>The winning team scores as many points as there are white stars on Boss
        Yokai they captured this round (ignoring the Boss Yokai of the trump
        suit).</p>

    <h3>End of the Game</h3>
    <p>If a team has 7 or more points they win!</p>

    <p>Otherwise, a new hand is dealt and another round is played. The lead
        alternates between players.</p>
