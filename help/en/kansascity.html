    <h2>Contents &amp; Materials Needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A Deck of 56 Cards, 7 Suits, 1-8 in Each Suit, Trump Suit &amp;
            Number Shown on Back</li>
        <li>Pencil &amp; Paper to Track Score (Not Included)</li>
        <li>This Rules Sheet</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Concept</h2>
    <p>In this must-follow trick-taking game, players try to win tricks, but
        only to a certain point. Along the way, if they lose tricks, they can
        upgrade their cards to the trump suit (which is on the back of all
        cards).</p>
    <p>In many trick-taking games, players get dealt a hand of cards, assess the
        strength of their hand, and then make their bid. This game is the
        reverse: players are aiming for a fixed number of tricks, and they can
        adjust the strength of their hand by upgrading their cards.</p>
    <p>This game is set up so that each hand at least one player will go over
        the ideal number of tricks. You can make your hand stronger, but it
        might cause you to have too strong of a hand!</p>

    <h2>Set Up</h2>
    <p>Shuffle all 56 cards and deal them evenly between players. Each player
        should have 14 cards (in the 4-player game) or 11 cards (in the 5-player
        game). In the 5-player game, show everybody the missing card and set it
        aside; it will not be needed. Before the trick-taking play begins, each
        player secretly passes three cards of their choosing to the clockwise
        player. In the beginning, no player has trump cards.</p>

    <h2>The Trick-taking Game</h2>
    <p>The player to the left of the dealer leads into the trick. Players then
        play into this trick in clockwise order. Each player will play one card
        on their turn, and they must follow suit if they can. If they cannot
        follow suit, they can play any card, including a trump suit card.</p>
    <p>The winner of the trick is the player playing the highest trump card. If
        there is no trump card in the trick, the highest of suit led wins.</p>
    <p>The winning player takes the cards. Starting with the player to the left
        of the trick winner, the players who lost the trick may, in clockwise
        order, choose to upgrade one of their cards to the trump suit. They take
        a card from their hand and put it facedown on the table (so the trump
        suit is showing). It is now a card of the trump suit; the suit on the
        other side no longer matters. This allows players the opportunity to
        short-suit themselves (and potentially make their hand stronger).</p>
    <p>Only one trump card of each rank (i.e., of a given number, 1-8) may be on
        the table at any given time. If upgrading a card would violate this
        rule, the card cannot be upgraded. If a trump card has already been
        played into a trick, though, that rank is no longer on the table, so
        that rank can again be upgraded. What trump cards a player has is public
        knowledge.</p>
    <p>The winner of the trick will lead the next trick. They may lead trump.
        The trick play and upgrading above will be repeated. Play will continue
        until all cards in the hand have been played.</p>

    <h2>Game Scoring</h2>
    <p>See the chart below for a quick scoring overview.</p>
    <p>In the 4-player game, players get 5 points per trick for the first three
        tricks they win. In the 5-player game, players get 5 points per trick
        for the first two tricks they win. If they go over the limit by one
        trick, they only get 5 total points. If they capture more tricks than
        that, they get no points from tricks taken. Additionally, regardless of
        how many tricks they won, players earn two points for each 4-rank card
        captured.</p>

    <h2>Additional Hands and Victory Condition</h2>
    <p>Play three hands, rotating the dealer (and thus start player) each hand.
        Track score between hands. High score wins. In the event of a tie,
        victory is shared. For a longer game, play one round per player.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions and Insights on the Game</h2>
    <h3>Do I have to show other players the face of the cards I have upgraded to
        trump?</h3>
    <p>No. In fact, you shouldn&rsquo;t do so, since upgrading cards allows you
        to short suit yourself.</p>

    <h3>Where did the idea come from?</h3>
    <p>Many card games have suits visible on the back. I wanted to make a game
        where the numbers were visible on the back. I also love games where you
        can adjust the strength of your hand.</p>

    <h3>What is the game&rsquo;s theme?</h3>
    <p>Much ado has been made in recent years about the rise and growth in
        trick-taking. But in Kansas City, we have had an active trick-taking
        group called The Kansas City Trick-Taking Society since about 2015. This
        game is made to celebrate that great group of gamers.</p>
