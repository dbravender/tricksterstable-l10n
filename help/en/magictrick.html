    <p>Please note that the rules have been edited to describe how Magic Trick
        is played in the Trickster's Table app. No rules have been changed but
        the interface does take care of some things for you. Rules explaining
        how the game is played in real life can be found on the <a

    <h3>Deck Composition</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>56 cards</li>
        <li>7 Suits, 0-7 in Each Suit, With Different Colored Backs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Setup</h3>

    <p>The deck is shuffled and dealt. Each player receives 14 cards. Cards are
        sorted by value from high to low. For the top and bottom player, this
        means cards are sorted from top left (low) to bottom right (high). For
        the left and right player cards are sorted from top to bottom top left
        is low and bottom right is high.</p>

    <h3>Gameplay</h3>

    <p>The player to the left of the dealer starts the hand. They play a card of
        their choosing into the trick, revealing it face up. Players then play
        into this trick in clockwise order. Each player will play one card on
        their turn, and they must follow suit if they can. If they cannot
        follow, they can play any card. The winner of the trick is the player
        playing the highest trump card; otherwise, it is the highest card of the
        leading suit. The red suit (hearts) is always trump. The winner puts the
        cards in front of them and leads the next trick. Play will continue
        until all cards have been played.</p>

    <p>After playing a card into a trick, but before the next player plays, a
        player may also put a card "up their sleeve."" They put it face up on
        the table for all to see (including themselves), and then their bid
        counter is updated to show this value for the rest of the hand. All
        players must put one card (but never more) up their sleeve at some point
        in the hand immediately after playing a card; otherwise, their last card
        when the hand ends will go up their sleeve. Cards up a sleeve cannot be
        played into a trick.</p>

    <p>Remember: a player can only put a card up their sleeve on their turn,
        after they have already played into the trick. Thus, if a player's plan
        was to put a card up their sleeve, but it is their only card that they
        have to follow suit, they must play it to the trick instead.

    <p>Scoring: <i>Bid Scoring</i>: Players earn three points if the face value
        of the card up their sleeve matches the number of tricks they took,
        including the 0 bet. Otherwise, they lose one point for the difference
        between the face value and the number of tricks they took. (For example,
        if a player took 1 or 5 tricks, and the card up their sleeve had a rank
        of 3, they'd lose 2 points.)</p>

    <p><i>Prestige Bonus</i>: Players earn an additional two-point bonus if they
        met their bid and if the number of suits they took in their tricks
        matches the rank of the card up their sleeve. There is no penalty for
        missing the prestige bonus. This bonus also scores for the 0 bet.
        Players can choose to play without the prestige bonus, but it is
        recommended for advanced players. (Note: this rule is enabled in the
        Trickster's Table implementation.)</p>

    <p><b>Additional Hands and Victory Condition</b>: Play hands equal to the
        number of players, rotating the dealer (and thus the start player)
        clockwise each hand. Record the scores after each hand. High score wins
        at the end of the game. In the event of a tie, the tied player who
        received the prestige bonus more times wins. If playing without the
        prestige bonus, the player among the tied players who hit their bid with
        the fewest tricks in the last round wins. If there is still a tie,
        victory is shared.</p>
