    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>Hotdog is a two-player trick-taking game. At the beginning of each round,
        players will have a chance to pick the card ranking, trump suit, and a
        special rank. Along with a hand of cards, each player will also be dealt
        a plate of cards. Plate cards count as part of the player's hand, but
        they are visible for all to see.</p>

    <h2>MATERIALS</h2>
    <p>Hotdog is played with a 36-card pack that consists of ones through 9's in
        four suits. A piece of paper and a pencil is needed for keeping score.
        See the SCORE section for more details.</p>

    <h2>SETUP</h2>
    <p>Cut the deck to determine who will be the first dealer. The player who
        cuts the lowest card deals first. For the following rounds, the deal
        alternates between the two players.</p>
    <p>Each player is dealt five cards face down. The cards should form a row in
        front of each player. Next, five cards are dealt face up with one card
        on top of each face-down card. This row is referred to as the Plate.
        Finally, each player is dealt a hand of 7 cards. These cards are not to
        be seen by the opposite player.</p>
    <p>The remaining two cards are placed face-down off to the side.</p>

    <h2>PICK YOUR TOPPINGS (Bidding)</h2>
    <p>After looking at their hand, the non-dealer has the first chance to pick
        the deck's ranking structure and a trump suit. They may choose to play
        with Ketchup, Mustard, or The Works.</p>
    <p>If a player does not wish to pick a topping, they may pass. Passing gives
        the opposite player an opportunity to pick.</p>
    <p>The player who picks the toppings for the round is called the Picker.</p>

    <h2>PLAYING WITH KETCHUP</h2>
    <p>If a player wants to play with the standard ranking in place, they say,
        "Let's play with Ketchup." Then, they pick the trump suit for the round.
        This suit becomes the highest-ranking suit for the round.</p>
    <p>(Example) Player 1 says, "Let's play with Ketchup. Spades are trump." The
        cards will rank (low) 1 - 9 (high), and Spades will be the highest
        suit for the round.</p>

    <h2>PLAYING WITH MUSTARD</h2>
    <p>If the player wants to play with a reversed card ranking, meaning 9's are
        low and ones are high, they say, "Let's play with Mustard." Then they
        pick the suit they want as trump.</p>
    <p>(Example) Player 1 says, "Let's play with Mustard. Diamonds are trump."
        This means that the round will be played with the cards ranking (low) 9
        - 1 (high), and Diamonds are the highest suit for the round.</p>

    <h2>PLAYING WITH THE WORKS</h2>
    <p>The third option a player has is to pick The Works. This means that there
        is no trump suit; it also means the card ranking will switch direction
        with each trick!</p>
    <p>When playing with the works, the player who leads the first trick decides
        whether it is played with Ketchup or Mustard. From there, card ranking
        alternates with each trick.</p>

    <h2>SMOTHERING (Overbidding)</h2>
    <p>If Ketchup or Mustard is picked, and the opponent does not like what has
        been called, they can choose to Smother (overbid) by saying, "I'll
        smother it". The other player's choice is cancelled, and the round will
        be played with The Works instead. The player who smothered becomes the
        Picker.</p>

    <h2>ADDING SOME RELISH</h2>
    <p>After Ketchup, Mustard, or The Works has been picked, the opposite player
        may add Relish by selecting a special rank for the round.</p>
    <p>(Example) The player wants 3's as the special rank, so they say, "I'll
        add some 3's as Relish."</p>
    <p>If they do not wish to select a special rank, they can say "No Relish".
    </p>
    <p>Cards of this special rank automatically win the trick if the trick
        includes a card from a different suit. If two special rank cards are
        played, the second card wins.</p>

    <h2>FIRST TRICK</h2>
    <p>The Picker leads to the first trick. If both players pass, the non-dealer
        leads the first trick. They may play one card from their hand, or they
        can play one face-up card from their plate. If a plate card is played,
        and a face-down card is exposed, that card is not flipped face-up until
        after the trick is complete.</p>
    <p>The opposite player must follow suit if they can. If the player cannot
        follow suit, they may play any card.</p>

    <h2>SCORE</h2>
    <p>The Picker must capture at least 9 tricks. Doing so earns them 1 game
        point. If they capture 12 tricks, they earn 2 game points. If the Picker
        captures 15 tricks, they automatically win the game.</p>
    <p>However, if the Picker fails to capture at least 9 tricks, the opponent
        earns 2 game points. If the opponent captures 12 tricks they
        automatically win the game.</p>

    <h2>CONTINUE THE GAME</h2>
    <p>Once the score for the round is tallied, collect the cards. Deal
        alternates each round. Continue playing rounds until the game ends.</p>

    <h2>WIN</h2>
    <p>The first player to earn 5 game points wins.</p>
    <p>For a complete match, play the best of three games.</p>

    <h2>THE FOOTLONG OPTION (Variant)</h2>
    <p>At any time during the bidding (including after a Smother), when it is
        your turn to bid you can take The Footlong Option by saying "I'll take a
        Footlong..."</p>
    <p>(Example) Player 1 says, "Let's play with Ketchup. Spades are trump."
        Player 2 says "I'll take a Footlong with Mustard. Diamonds are trump."
    </p>
    <p>Player 1 can Smother to overbid or choose Relish to accept the bid.</p>
